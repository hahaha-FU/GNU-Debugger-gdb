### Run & Continue:
- *Concept*: Learn the basic `r` (run) and `c` (continue) commands.
- *Why it matters*: In exploitation, you often need to restart the program multiple times and resume execution after breakpoints.

**Key Commands:**
- `run` → starts the program inside gdb.
- `continue` → resumes execution until the next breakpoint or end.
