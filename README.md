### The Tool: gdb (GNU Debugger)

GDB is a debugger used to analyze, run, and control the execution of binaries. In exploitation, reverse engineering, and debugging, gdb is one of the most important tools because it lets you:

- Run and stop programs at any point
- Inspect registers and memory
- Set breakpoints and step through instructions
- Modify values at runtime
